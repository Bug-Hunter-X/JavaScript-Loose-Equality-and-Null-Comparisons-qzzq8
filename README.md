This repository demonstrates a common JavaScript error involving loose equality (==) and null comparisons.  The `bug.js` file shows a function with a flawed null check that leads to unexpected behavior.  The `bugSolution.js` file provides the corrected version using strict equality (===).  Understanding the difference between loose and strict equality is crucial for writing robust and reliable JavaScript code.
